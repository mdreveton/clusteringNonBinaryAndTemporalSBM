Folder nonBinarySBM: code for Algorithm 1 on non binary SBMs (i.e. SBM with homogeneous interactions sampled from Gaussian, exponential, geometric, etc. distributions)

Folder temporalSBM: code for Algorithms 1, 2 and 3 on Markov SBMs (i.e., SBM with homogeneous interactions sampled from Markov distributions) and on the 3 high school data sets from SocioPatterns.
